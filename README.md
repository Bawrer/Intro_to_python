Learning Resources: Python's ease of learning and the abundance of online resources, tutorials, and courses make it accessible to newcomers, contributing to its popularity in the job market.

## HISTORY OF PYTHON

Python was conceived in the late 1980s and Guido van Rossum started implementing it at CWI in the Netherlands in December 1989. 

Python strikes a good balance between fast compilations and readability, and it is easier to write applications.

Python is implemented in C and relies on the extensive, well understood, portable C libraries.

## COMMENTS IN PYTHON
In programming comments are texts that are ignored by the compilers and they explain certain parts of the code. We add comments for the code to be easily understood and readable.

A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character.

In python they are led by the '#' for single line comments  and  ''' for multiple comments.

## ACTIVITY 3
1. print("""This is how the backslash character is displayed

in Python

“\\”""")

2. print("****  *   * ********* *   *  ****  *     *\n*  *   * *      *     *   * *    * * *   * \n****    *       *     ***** *    * *  *  *\n*       *       *     *   * *    * *   * * \n*       *       *     *   *  ****  *     *" )
